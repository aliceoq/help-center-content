## Summary


When an registered user (not logged in) start the checkout with Delivery as the shipping option, and later changes to pickup, when trying to finish the checkout the error message "_O campo Número nos dados de entrega é inválido_" will appear and not allow to place the order.


##

## Simulation



1. Go to checkout and add a new item
2. Input a zipcode to calculate shipping and keep **Delivery** selected
3. Proceed to checkout and when asked to input an email use one from a registered user
4. Checkout will show a pop-up message informing your personal data was retrieved from past purchases
5. Change from Delivery to Pick-Up and try to complete the order (the error message will show)
