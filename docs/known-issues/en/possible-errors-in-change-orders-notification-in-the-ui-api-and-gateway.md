## Summary


Some problems were identified in the Change Orders V1 architecture, where some cases were not notified in the order interaction in the UI, were not notified in the Get Orders API, however, there was a discount or increase in the value. We have also seen scenarios where the notification occurs in the UI and API, however, the discount or increase is not made at the gateway.


##

## Simulation


It is not possible to carry out a simulation, as the scenarios are sporadic and generally occur due to a timeout error, which we have already increased the timer for.


##

## Workaround


Initially we do not have a workaround, however, it is worth mentioning that some scenarios we will be able to adjust manually, such as if the registration of change orders occurs in the gateway and does not occur in the Marketplace or fulfillment order interaction and in the API as well.
