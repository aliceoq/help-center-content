## Summary


Unified Indexing considers the messages' translations from the main account when using a subaccount architecture to implement cross-border stores. This leads to a different translation in the search and product page.


##

## Simulation



- Create a subaccount and implement cross-border stores;
- Translate the catalog content in the subaccount;
- Compare the search and product page; they will have different translations.


##

## Workaround


Set the cross-border locale also in the main account and replicate the translation in the subaccount's message in the main account.
