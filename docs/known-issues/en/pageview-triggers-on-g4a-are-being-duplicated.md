## Summary


The Pageview trigger is showing duplicated entries in G4A when used in the search block.


##

## Simulation


When checking G4A pageview triggers for search events we can notice that they are being duplicated as well as generating unrelated triggers in other views.
It was also tried to check the issue using only the default theme and the behavior still persists.


##

## Workaround
