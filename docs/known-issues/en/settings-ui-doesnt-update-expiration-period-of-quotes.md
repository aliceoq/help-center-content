## Summary


Basically, in the B2B Quote settings UI the value that input isn’t being saved.

The default is 30 days, when we input 15 and click on the save button, we see that the property “cartLifeSpan” is sent as null.

## Simulation


Enter in the settings page and change the "expiration period".
