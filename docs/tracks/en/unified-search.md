On VTEX Sales App's endless aisle, the sales associate can search for the desired products and add them to the cart. To do this, they must click on the magnifier on the top bar of VTEX Sales App and enter the product name, the reference code, or the EAN.

VTEX Sales App has a unified search, which means that, when a sales associate searches for a product in the application, both the local inventory (of the physical store itself) and other physical stores and distribution centers associated with the ecommerce are included in the search.

By clicking the <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i> arrow next to a product, you can see its variations, delivery options, the quantity to be added to the cart, and the `Add to cart` and `More details` buttons.

## Filters

To use the search filters in VTEX Sales App, it is necessary to first install and configure [VTEX Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3qgT47zY08biLP3d5os3DG). In this context, please note that:

* It is essential to configure the filters that will be displayed, as indicated in the article [Search configuration](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/5t75L6lYNwix93l41s1Yrx). Otherwise, all product information will be considered as filterable attributes in VTEX Sales App.
* The **Autocomplete** option does not apply to the VTEX Sales App search, so it can be left empty.
* Any changes made to the search settings will also apply to the ecommerce if the tool used is VTEX Intelligent Search.

In addition to configuring VTEX Intelligent Search, it is necessary to [contact VTEX support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) to enable the filter feature in VTEX Sales App.

Once the filters are enabled, you can use this feature by following the process below when searching for products.

1. If you are using VTEX Sales App on a mobile device, such as a smartphone, click on `Filter search`. If you are using a device with a larger screen, skip this step.
2. Select the desired filters.
3. Click on `Filter Search`.

The results displayed will be filtered according to your preferences.
