Search configuration comprises all VTEX Intelligent Search global settings. It consists of two sections: [General Settings](#general-settings) and [Facet Settings](#facet-settings).

## General settings
These are the settings that handle the totality of VTEX Intelligent Search. This feature is composed by the following option:
Use SKU specifications to display individual products in search results: defines which specifications will be used to separate SKUs in search results. 

Suppose you have a product available in two different colors: blue and red. If you select the attribute "color" in this field, the search result will return two different products (one blue and one red) instead of only one product.
To configure this field, click on the drop-down arrow and select the specifications you want to add.

## Facet settings
Using the intelligent search on Admin V4, you are able to edit your searchâ€™s facet. The available configurations are:

- **Facet order:** order in which the filters will be displayed in the store. If you do not have any facet selected, the default order will be alphabetical. To add a facet, click on `Add`, select a filter and click on `Save`. You can change the sorting by dragging the three stacked lines icon. You can also click the trash button <i class="fa-solid fa-trash-can"></i> to delete the facet.
- **Hide facets:** option that allows you to hide certain filters in the store. To hide a filter, click on the dropdown menu and select it.
