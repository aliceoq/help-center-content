After creating your Google Merchant Center account, define the [trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-uma-politica-comercial--563tbcL0TYKEKeOY4IAgAE) that you are going to use. When you [configure a trade policy for a marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurando-a-politica-comercial-para-marketplace/), you determine which products will be submitted to Google Shopping and their price on the platform.

In most cases, we recommend choosing the main trade policy (ID: 1), as Google Shopping results direct buyers to purchase from advertisersâ€™ stores. Therefore, the integration will submit all the products available in your store to Google at the same advertised prices.

You will need to request the creation of a new trade policy only if you want to: 
- Offer a different product assortment on Google Shopping.
- Sell products at different prices on Google Shopping.

To [request additional trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X), please open a ticket to our [Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) by selecting Commercial and Create a trade policy.

Requesting additional trade policies to integrate with [native connectors](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex), [certified connectors (partners)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-certified-connector-partner), or other VTEX stores is free of charge.

## Submitting product prices

The [price](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/3N9xYhnampRQOrfaTAOxNu) of your product on Google Shopping is determined when you choose the trade policy. It is essential to pay attention to a few things.

If your trade policy includes [list prices](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/3XcXp0r5WrJvogB8KIX4Kx#preco-de-lista) and [computed prices](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/7GptzvlPDVM11ojEjywIQx#preco-computado), the latter will be sent to Google Shopping. For these promotions to be displayed on Google Shopping, the products must meet the following requirements in the Merchant Center:  

- The base price, or a higher amount, must have been charged for 30 days, consecutively or not, in the last 200 days.
- The base price must be valid.
- The promotional price must be lower than the base price.
- The promotion discount must be greater than 5% and less than 90% off the base price.  

Once your products meet all the requirements listed above, the tool applies the promotional value previously configured on VTEX to the Google Shopping views.  

## Discount linked to payment method  

You can activate a discount linked to a payment method in two steps: First, [configure the discount](#configuring-discounts) and the payment method. Then, activate the discounts in the [connector configuration](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-o-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw/wWyl0Njxgs5KfXvxYZJrl). 

### Configuring discounts  

To configure a discount linked to a payment method, see the following documentation:

1. [Set a discount using the checkout API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/set-a-discount-using-the-checkout-api) to enter the desired payment method in the `paymentSystemToCheckFirstInstallment` variable and simulate a shopping cart to make sure the payment method was updated. 
2.  [Configuring a discount for orders prepaid in full](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-desconto-de-preco-a-vista--7Lfcj9Wb5dpYfA2gKkACIt) to link an SKU to a payment method.
3. [Configuring discounts for orders prepaid in full on Google Shopping](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-desconto-de-preco-a-vista-para-google-shopping--40K3R5d4NogMvCzIWdWt3e)

After following these instructions, you should activate the connector by [configuring the connector](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-o-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw/wWyl0Njxgs5KfXvxYZJrl).
