2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __PayMee__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__ and __Application Token__ fields with the data provided by PayMee.
5. Click `Save`.

## Settting up PayMee payment condition

1. Within the __Settings__ section of Payments, click on the __Payment Conditions__ tab.
2. Click the __+__ button.
3. Click the __PayMee__ payment method.
4. Click the __Status__ button to enable this payment condition.
5. If desired, check the box __Use Anti-Fraud__ to activate the basic anti-fraud.
6. Click __Save__.

That's it! Now __PayMee__ checkout option will be displayed for your customers.
