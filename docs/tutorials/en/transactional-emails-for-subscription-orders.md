## How your customer tracks their Subscription Orders

<div class = "alert alert-info">

Each action that occurs within the Subscription order flow contains a trigger that sends an email notifying your customer. After activating the Subscription, your customer will receive e-mails with details of the status of each subscription order every time they perform an action.

It is not necessary to activate the e-mail sending manually, since they are sent automatically according to each scenario included in the Message Center. However, if you wish, you can disable the sending of specific emails:

1. Access the **Message Center** module in the Admin.
2. Click on the **Templates** tab.
3. Search for **Subscriptions** in the search box.
4. Click on the **card** of the desired template to configure it.
5. Uncheck the `Enable e-mail sending?` box.
6. Click on **Save**.
