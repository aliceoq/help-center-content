The _Risk Assessment_ process is critical to the proper functioning of a supplier risk management program. 

The procedure consists of third-party risk assessment questionnaires designed to help an organization identify potential risks among its suppliers and third-party partners. By doing the risk assessment, they are able to: 
- Check whether VTEX meets the security requirements set by the client.
- Learn technical details about the security architecture.
- Assess potential platform risks.

To support risk assessments of its clients, VTEX provides a FAQ with key questions and answers related to the platform's structure and security.

Learn more by accessing the Risk Assessment FAQ below, available upon login into the VTEX Admin.
