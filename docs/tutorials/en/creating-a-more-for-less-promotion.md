## 4. Restrictions and limitations of use

- **How many times will this promotion be applied in your store**: limits the number of times the promotion can be applied. If you deselect the **unlimited** field, the **times** field becomes available to enter the maximum number of times the promotion can be applied. Since the promotion has already been created, this condition will only apply from the day it was configured, not affecting previous orders.
- **How many times per customer will this promotion be applied**: the number entered in this field determines the maximum number of times each customer can use the promotion. If the above field is also selected, it will have a higher priority for action than this limit.
- **Set maximum number of eligible items for each cart**: determines the maximum number of items in the cart to which the promotion can apply. Read [this article](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/promocoes--6asfF1vFYiZgTQtOzwJchR/jOu9b69mKbrTDfSJYAawy#restricting-promotional-products-in-cart) to learn how to configure this field.
  If you do not select this option, the discount will be applied to the products of the collection or SKU list, even if the number of items per product is less than the number defined in the promotion. So the system will consider the sum of the eligible products in the shopping cart.
- **Apply with other promotions**: if selected, more than one promotion can be applied simultaneously, regardless of the discount type. Learn more about [concurrent promotions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/understanding-competition-of-promotions--tutorials_2270).
- **Apply with manual prices**: allows the promotion to apply to products whose prices were manually added via telesales. To enable the manual pricing feature, use the [Update orderForm configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/configuration#updateorderformconfiguration) endpoint.
