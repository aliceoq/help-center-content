All clients and partners have access to support provided by the [VTEX support](https://help.vtex.com/en/faq/como-funciona-o-suporte-da-vtex--3kACEfni4m8Yxa1vnf2ebe) team of specialists. To contact them, you must open a ticket through the ticket system.

Our specialists are qualified to provide the best possible experience to solve every ticket. However, there are some guidelines you should follow when opening a ticket to ensure a faster and more streamlined process.

Keep in mind that the more context you provide our specialists with, the quicker they'll be able to find a solution to your problem.

This article aims to guide clients and partners on opening tickets with key information to speed up the investigation process for our specialists. It's divided into two sections:

- [General guidelines](#general-guidelines)
- [Key information per scenario](#key-information-per-scenario)

## General guidelines

Before opening a ticket, you need to check if the issue is related to your store customization. 

To do so, you need to perform two main actions depending on your store:

**For CMS stores**

1. Block files in the devtools of the page (`.js` and `.css`).

![Dev tools](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/1BXRvp3Ogpx83gJnB5kFeG/290afadc99140b6f5c8d0a3cc645ef3b/devtolls.png)  

2. Run the action that had an error in the cart or checkout.

**For VTEX IO stores**

1. Link the default VTEX IO theme to a development workspace.   
2. In the workspace, replicate the process that causes the error on the website.  

If the error persists, open a ticket to the VTEX team following the guidelines below. If the error does not occur after blocking the files or when using the default VTEX IO theme, it means that the error is related to the customization of the website. To solve it, please contact the team responsible for your store frontend.
