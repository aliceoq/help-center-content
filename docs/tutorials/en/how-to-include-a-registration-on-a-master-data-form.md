To include a registration, just access the Master Data module and choose the application you wish to view.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
This article describes how Master Data v1 works. It is important that you evaluate which Master Data version meets the needs of your operation or is already in use.

Let us say, for example, that you want to edit the information of a customer of your store.

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Store Settings** > **Storefront** > **Master Data**.
2. In Master Data, click **Aplications**.
2. In the **Profile System** application, choose the form **Clientes**.![2- EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/4RQqh0CFIQqC0kYAKOSSEW/0e0076f1bbbf8839057dc737370c218b/2-_EN.png)
3. Search for the user using the **E-mail** field (or another field defined in the data entity as searchable).
4. Click once on **Editar** inside the user registration; !![2.1 - EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5lI5B5gtDqC4Y22ogykYU8/437cbd32a17b05d2a59686a5e535dff1/2.1_-_EN.png)
5. Edit as desired and click on **Salvar**.

The information shown in this example comes from the **CL** data entity, and its fields can be set up as editable, or not, directly in the data entity.

To access this area, you must go to the **Dynamic Storage** area, which is located at the following address: https://_STORENAME_.ds.vtexcrm.com.br
