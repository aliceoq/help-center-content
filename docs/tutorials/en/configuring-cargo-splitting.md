Cargo splitting is the configuration that allows a purchase to be divided into multiple deliveries, when the calculation of total weight exceeds the carrier limit.

This configuration is very important because, if cargo splitting is not allowed, the closing of a purchase may preclude. So, use it if the sum of the weight of all products in the cart is bigger than the maximum weight registered for carriers.

### How to configure

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store settings > Shipping > Settings**, or type *Shipping* in the search bar at the top of the page and select *Store settings / Shipping*.  
2. On the **Load sharing when carrier limit is reached** area, select the option *Allow the order and split deliveries.*.   
3. Click on **Save**.
