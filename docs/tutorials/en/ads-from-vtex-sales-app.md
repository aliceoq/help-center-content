## Access ads in the VTEX Sales App

In the VTEX Sales App, the seller will have the ability to access the ad page in two different ways:

* **Homepage:** If the store administrator previously registered the ad page as the seller's homepage, upon logging into the platform, the seller will be directed straight to the ad page. This configuration ensures that sellers are always up-to-date with relevant ads and promotions as soon as they access the system.
* **Explore Menu:** If the ad page is not set as the seller's homepage, it can still be easily accessed through the **Explore** menu. To access the ad page, the seller should click on the **Explore** menu. This will directly take the seller to the ad page, where they can view and interact with the available products and promotions.
