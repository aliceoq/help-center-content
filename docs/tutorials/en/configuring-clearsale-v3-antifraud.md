3. Choose the product __Personalized HTML Tag__.
4. Enter the following script, replacing `your-app` with the identifier sent to you by ClearSale (between single quotes):

  ```
    var deviceFingerprintIdCSV4 = 10000000 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 99999999);
    (function (a, b, c, d, e, f, g) {
    a['CsdpObject'] = e; a[e] = a[e] || function () {
    (a[e].q = a[e].q || []).push(arguments)
    }, a[e].l = 1 * new Date(); f = b.createElement(c),
    g = b.getElementsByTagName(c)[0]; f.async = 1; f.src = d; g.parentNode.insertBefore(f, g)
    })(window, document, 'script', '//device.clearsale.com.br/p/fp.js', 'csdp');
    csdp('app', 'your-app');
    csdp('sessionid', deviceFingerprintIdCSV4);
    window.vtex.deviceFingerprint = deviceFingerprintIdCSV4;
  ```

5. Check the option __Support for document.write__.
6. In __Trigger In__, select the option __More__ and click on __New__.

## CustomSLA field details

The value entered in the **Custom SLA in minutes** field when configuring the anti-fraud solution is one of the three possible values for the `customSLA` field. If the cart is empty, the `customSLA` value will be the value of the `shippingEstimate` field for the transaction cart. If the cart has at least one item, the `customSLA` value will be the lowest value between the `deliverySlaInMinutes` value of the first item in the cart and the **Custom SLA in minutes** value used when configuring the anti-fraud solution.

The `shippingEstimate` and `deliverySlaInMinutes` values correspond to the delivery time and are generated at checkout from information in the Logistics module. The calculation of the delivery time is explained in the article [How is the delivery time is calculated?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-is-the-order-delivery-deadline-calculated--1TOuKCIjGQmqOqQkEqCg82).

The `shippingEstimate` value is obtained from a calculation made by the Logistics module. The value is followed by a letter, which represents the time unit used. The letters are:

- `d` for calendar days or `bd` for working days if the time is zero or at least 24 hours.
- `h` for hours if the time is less than 24 hours and at least 2 hours.
- `m` for minutes if time is less than 2 hours.

The `shippingEstimate` field can be obtained from the `shippingData.logisticsInfo[]` items in the <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/orders#getorder" target="_blank">Get Order</a> endpoint response.

The `deliverySlaInMinutes` value is the conversion of `shippingEstimate` into minutes. If the unit is `m` (minutes), the value will be the same. If the unit is `h` (hours), the value is multiplied by 60, and if the unit is `d` (calendar days) or `bd` (working days), the value is multiplied by 1440. For example, three calendar days or `3d` is represented as `4320`. The `deliverySlaInMinutes` field is used in each item of the `minicart` in the request body of the <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/antifraud-flow#sendantifraudpreanalysisdata" target="_blank">Send Antifraud Pre-Analysis Data</a> and <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/antifraud-flow#sendantifrauddata" target="_blank">Send Antifraud Data</a> endpoints.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Although the time conversion in calendar days (<code>d</code>) and working days (<code>bd</code>) to minutes is the same in the <code>deliverySlaInMinutes</code> field, the delivery date may be different depending on the calendar (when there are weekends and holidays within the delivery window).
