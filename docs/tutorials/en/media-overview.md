Media is responsible for managing your store's media files, such as images and GIFs. With Media, you can upload and organize media files in the following formats: `PNG`, `JPG`, `GIF`, `SVG`, and `WEBP`.

In addition, Media is integrated with **Site Editor** and **Headless CMS**. This integration allows you to access and manage Media directly through VTEX CMS solutions.

<div style="background-color:#FCF8F2; border-left: 2px solid #F0AD4E; border-top-left-radius: 2px; border-bottom-left-radius: 2px; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px">
  The file size limit for uploading to Media is <b>5 MB</b>.
</div>

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- [Access Media](#accessing-media)
- [Manage files in Media](#managing-files-in-media)

## Accessing Media
There are three ways to access Media:

- **Media**: In the VTEX Admin, go to **Storefront > Media**.

- **Site Editor** (for stores using the Store Framework): In the VTEX Admin, go to **Storefront > Site Editor**, choose a block that contains an image (e.g. Carousel), and click `Add`.  A modal will open.

- **Headless CMS**: In the VTEX Admin, go to **Storefront > Headless CMS**. Choose one of the created pages, such as a product page. From the available sections, select one to which you can add an image (for example, Hero), and click the Hero image component. A modal will open.

In the following image, you can see an overview of the Media interface and the actions available for managing your media files:

| Field | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| **I - Search Field** | Search for available files in Media. |
| **II - Sort by** | Sort how files are displayed in the interface based on the filters: `Newest`, `Oldest`, `Name (A-Z)`, and `Name (Z-A)`. |
| **III - Pages** Browse the available file pages. |
| **IV - View Mode** | Choose the view mode for the files: `List View` or `Grid View`. |
| **V - Add Image** | Upload a new file from your device. |

## Managing files in Media
See in the sections below the actions available for managing files in Media:

### Uploading files to Media
1. On the **Media** page, click `Add New`.
2. Choose the image you want to upload and click `Open`.

<div style="background-color:#FCF8F2; border-left: 2px solid #F0AD4E; border-top-left-radius: 2px; border-bottom-left-radius: 2px; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px">
Keep in mind that Media supports the following formats: <i>PNG</i>, <i>JPG</i>, <i>GIF</i>, <i>SVG</i>, and <i>WEBP</i>, with a file size limit of 5 MB.
</div>

3. After the image is loaded, a success message will be displayed. Now, you can perform other actions by clicking `More actions` (three vertical dots) on the image thumbnail and choosing one of the following actions:

| Field | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| **View** | Opens the image on a new page. |
| **Copy URL** | Copies the URL of the image so that you can use it in other sections of your store. |
| **Download** | Downloads the image to your computer. |
| **Delete** |	Deletes the image from the repository. |

<div style="background-color:#FCF8F2; border-left: 2px solid #F0AD4E; border-top-left-radius: 2px; border-bottom-left-radius: 2px; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px">
Deleting the image will only remove it from the Media repository. If you have added the image to a Hero component, for example, the image will continue to be used in that component. However, you will not be able to use it in other components.
</div>

### Canceling an upload in Media
If you are uploading a new image and do not want to continue, you can cancel the upload by clicking the `X` overlay on the image thumbnail.
