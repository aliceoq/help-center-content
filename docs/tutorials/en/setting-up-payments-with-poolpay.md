At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the PoolPay payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through the credit cards, PIX, ITP (Brazilian payment transaction initiator) and BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later).

To configure PoolPay affiliation, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings__ > __Payment__ > __Settings__, or type __Settings__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. In the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click on the __"+"__ button.
3. Click on the __PoolPay__ connector.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__ and __Application Token__ fields with the data provided by Liquido Payment.
5. In __Enable payout split and sending payment recipients?__, select whether split payments will be available for the marketplace and sellers.
6. Click on the __Save__ button.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by PoolPay, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).

To set special conditions on payment methods, go to [Configuring payment special conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456#).

After following the indicated steps, PoolPay connector may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
