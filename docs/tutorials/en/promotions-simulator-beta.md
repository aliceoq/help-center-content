The **Promotions Simulator** is a tool that allows you to see not only the promotions created in the VTEX platform and which were applied to the shopping cart, but also their activation conditions. Since there are multiple configurations for the promotions, it is important to be able to see the [competition](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/entendendo-a-concorrencia-de-promocoes--tutorials_2270), the accumulation of promotions during the purchase and the causes that trigger them.

By using the simulator, you will be able to manage the promotions in your store and target them according to your business strategy.

You can also [manage promotions](#managing-promotions), whether they are active or inactive, by clicking on the `Manage promotions` button.

The simulator interface has five columns:

| **Columns** |**Description**| 
| ----------- | ------------- |
| **Product** | List of products in the cart |
| **Price** | Previous price (of) and final price (by) of the promotion applied |
| **Quantity** | Total number of items in the cart |
| **Total** | Total price that will be charged for the product, considering the promotion discounts and the number of items |
| **Discount** | Status do desconto no carrinho, que podem serDiscount status in the cart, which can be: `Applied` ou `Not applied`. The status `Applied` indicates that at least one promotion has been applied to the product |

<div class = "alert alert-info">

To take advantage of the benefits of this feature, this article is divided into two sections:

- [Access the Promotions Simulator](#accessing-the-promotions-simulator)
- [Manage promotions](#managing-promotions)

## Accessing the Promotions Simulator

To access this feature, you need to [set up Cartman](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-o-cartman--1ACMTStZYkMqB0lTgwg451) first, a tool that simulates, shares and researches carts from VTEX stores.

When you access the Simulator, you'll see a list with the products in your cart. You'll see all the promotions that can be applied to each of the items, followed by a check box <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> in the promotion applied.

The tool includes a search bar to find the promotions by product name or by promotion name. Besides, you can filter the promotions by **Promotion type** and **Discount**.

By clicking on each product, you can see more information about the promotions that can be applied, details about your selection and the condition to activate them.
