In Master Data, customer and address forms are not created by default for all new stores. They are available only in the main store account. This occurs whenever multi-stores are created.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
This article describes how Master Data v1 works. It is important that you evaluate which Master Data version meets the needs of your operation or is already in use.

</ul>

You can produce these forms automatically, following the instructions below for each store.

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Store Settings** > **Storefront** > **Master Data**.
2. After authentication, access the following URL, to make a requisition (GET) from the API: `meusegundosite.vtexcrm.com.br/api/crm/pvt/provisioning`.
3. The result will be a blank screen on the browser, but this corresponds to a status "200" response.
4. Wait a few minutes and then click on **Advanced area** in Master Data.
6. Under **Do you want to clear the cache?** click on **Yes**.
7. Go back to the Master Data home page.
8. Click on **Reload Applications**.

After this the **Profile System** application forms should be available in your Master Data.
