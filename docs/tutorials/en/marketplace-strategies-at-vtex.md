A marketplace is a virtual platform through which different sellers offer their products. In addition to owning products, sellers are also responsible for delivering them to customers.

![Marketplace strategies](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/4tARnj2ViHYTBPPgiD9pWs/103ccbf1525c4bf65e049dd85aef5186/VTEX_Marketplace_650x400.png)

[VTEX promotes digital collaboration](https://vtex.com/us-en/ecommerce-marketplace/) in different scenarios. For example, in addition to selling your products on other marketplaces, you can also act as a marketplace and sell products from other sellers on your website.

In addition, VTEX allows you to manage everything in one place with a concept we call “one single panel”. With this unified management, you can manage your B2C catalog, pricing, inventory, and the different channels for which VTEX provides integration.

Here are some of the main transactions when selling products on marketplaces:

- Inventory control in multiple channels.
- Promotions sync.
- Order processing.
- Channel management.

At VTEX, there is no extra fee to integrate with marketplaces. There is also no additional charge for a VTEX store to offer products from sellers, or sell products in other VTEX stores.

Orders placed through marketplaces are subject to the same <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-a-vtex-considera-como-receita-para-apuracao--58j4cfoXfisWyemASACwSq?locale=pt">contractual rules</a> as the ones placed through other channels.

You select the product assortment to send to a marketplace when choosing your [trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV). To [request additional trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X), contact our Growth Operations team through *[Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support)* by selecting **Commercial** and `Create a trade policy`.

Requesting additional trade policies to integrate with certified connectors or other VTEX stores is free of charge.

Here are the scenarios we will address next:

- [Selling on marketplaces](#selling-on-marketplaces)
- [Acting as a marketplace](#acting-as-a-marketplace)

## Selling on marketplaces

Marketplaces are online sales spaces where sellers offer their products. There are several reasons why it can be strategically advantageous to sell on a marketplace. Some of the main ones are:

- **Gain visibility for your store**: centralizing different sellers and a wide variety of products on a single marketplace attracts user traffic. Besides, by offering your products on multiple channels, you can increase brand visibility and reach new audiences.
- **Use a cost-effective service**: each marketplace has its own commercial conditions. The most common one is to pay a commission on sales. Therefore, if a seller’s products do not sell, no commissions will be charged.
- **Increase sales**: operating in multiple channels diversifies your revenue streams and can increase conversion rates.
- **Diversify your audience**: you can define a specific product assortment for each marketplace, and from there build market validation strategies or make seasonal sales.
- **Add value to your products**: you can benefit from the trust relationship between a marketplace and its customers, especially if the audience is not familiar with your brand. This adds value to your product and can increase your conversion rates.

At VTEX, you can sell on other channels by:

A VTEX store can act simultaneously as a <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#being-a-vtex-seller">VTEX seller</a> and a <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#being-a-vtex-marketplace">VTEX marketplace</a>.

### Being a VTEX seller

VTEX's architecture allows stores hosted in the VTEX environment to sell their products in other VTEX stores. A VTEX store that sells its products on another VTEX store is called a VTEX seller. Later on in this article, you will see more information about VTEX stores that offer products from VTEX sellers, acting as [VTEX marketplaces](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#being-a-vtex-marketplace).

Setting up an [integration between VTEX stores](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-seller-para-vender-em-marketplace-vtex--6g045OkRSjNpqhkExbQRlP) is simple and has fewer steps than other integrations. You can also use the feature __Marketplaces and Integrations__, which has a catalog of stakeholders interested in partnerships, facilitating contact between VTEX sellers, VTEX marketplaces and certified connectors.

The [Seller Portal](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-portal-primeiros-passos--6w1vBdRH2uuBGmUqgNQjwK) is a VTEX platform edition for sellers to connect and sell their products on VTEX marketplaces. The portal allows sellers to access all the key features necessary to operate ecommerce on big storefronts, increasing visibility and sales conversion.

In VTEX, it is possible to act as a <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/definicoes-de-conta-franquia-e-seller-white-label--5orlGHyDHGAYciQ64oEgKa">white label seller</a>, a seller unknown to the consumer in his shopping experience. This type of seller is the standard for <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-franchise-account--kWQC6RkFSCUFGgY5gSjdl">franchise accounts</a>, for example, and can be strategic for certain business models.

### Integrating with marketplaces partners

There are external integrations, which were developed together with partner hubs.

VTEX provides a set of APIs and instructions to facilitate the process. See more details in the [guide for integrating with external marketplaces](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/external-marketplace-integration-guide).

## Acting as a marketplace

Besides selling on other marketplaces, your store can also sell products from other sellers. Here are some of the main advantages of acting as a marketplace:

- **Increase revenue**: there are different ways to monetize an online marketplace. The most common one is to receive a commission on sales made on your website.
- **Diversify your product offering**: you will be able to offer more products and options for your customers.
- **Reach new customers**: sellers attract new customers to the marketplace, expanding your market reach and increasing your brand visibility.
- **Improve your customer’s shopping experience**: by diversifying and expanding your product catalog, you deliver a higher quality customer experience. As a result, your customers will be able to buy everything they need in one place (one-stop-shop).
- **Keep your costs low**: this collaboration process does not increase your costs. It is a scalable model that does not require investments in inventory, structure, or staff because delivering products is the sellers' responsibility.
- **Improve your brand reputation:** if your store is well-known in the market, customers will trust your marketplace and the products you offer in your website. In addition, you can increase your profits by offering sellers an added value to their products.

A VTEX store can sell products from other sellers by:

- [Integrating with an external seller](#integrating-with-an-external-seller)

### Being a VTEX marketplace

VTEX's architecture allows stores hosted on the VTEX platform to offer products from other stores, be they VTEX stores or not. When a VTEX store starts selling products from other sellers, it becomes a VTEX marketplace.

Setting up your store to [become a VTEX marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-marketplace-vtex--7splyp5MqIyt2Iyz5jsNzb) is simple and has fewer steps than other integrations. Once your marketplace is set up, check out [Actions for a VTEX marketplace operation](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/acoes-para-a-operacao-de-marketplaces-vtex--2SdIflvwywiOqCpczKCfev).

You can also use the __Marketplaces and Integrations__ feature, which promotes and facilitates contact between VTEX marketplaces, VTEX sellers, and certified connectors interested in partnerships.

### Integrating with an external seller

For sellers that are not integrated with VTEX but want to sell their products on a VTEX marketplace, a custom connector can be developed for this integration. VTEX provides a set of APIs and instructions to facilitate the process. For more information, see our [guide for integrating with external sellers](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/external-seller-integration-guide).
