3. Click on the __LiquidoPayment__ connector.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__, __Application Token__ and __Client ID__ fields with the data provided by Liquido Payment.
5. Click on the __Save__ button.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by Liquido Payment, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).
