## Setting up a merchandising rule

To configure a merchandising rule in the Visual Editor, follow the steps below.

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Storefront**, or type **Storefront** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Under **Intelligent Search**, click **Merchandising Rules**.
3. Click the `+ New` button.
4. Fill in the following fields:
   * **Name**: Name of the merchandising rule. Example: Promote product A when searching for a chocolate cookie.
   * **Start date (optional)**: Set a date from which the merchandising rule will apply. The date follows the UTC-0 time zone.
   * **End date (optional)**: Set a date on which the merchandising rule will no longer apply to store searches. The date follows the UTC-0 time zone.
   * **Locales:** Languages to which the merchandising rule will apply.
5. Click **Visual Editor**. See [Types of editing](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/5tBSYXb9EIdePa0MWTnFd0#types-of-editing) for more information about each editor.
6. Click `Next`.
7. To define a search term that determines when the merchandising rule applies, enter the term in the search bar (item II in the previous image). You need to define at least one term or a filter (step 8) to apply the rule.
8. To create a filter to apply the merchandising rule (item III in the previous image), follow the steps described in the [Adding filters and conditions](#adding-filters-and-conditions) section. You need to define at least one filter or term (step 7) for the rule to apply.
9. You can also perform additional actions to customize the search results (items IV, V, VII, VIII, IX in the previous image).
10. Click `Save`.

### Adding filters and conditions

Filters are predefined selectable attributes that narrow the search results, such as filtering for all products in a category or brand, among other conditions. You can add one or more conditions to a filter.

To add a condition using the Visual Editor, follow the steps below.

1. Click `Filter`.
2. Click `+ Add condition`.
3. Fill in the desired conditions. The available options are detailed in [Merchandising rule conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3Dvava8LSVcFKeS2S6J7XW).
4. Click `Save`.

The defined conditions can work together (`and`) or alternatively (`or`).

In the <i class="far fa-ellipsis-v"></i> menu of each existing condition, you can `Duplicate` or `Delete` the condition. To deactivate all created conditions, click `Clear filters`.
