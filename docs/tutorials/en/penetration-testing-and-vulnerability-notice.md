VTEX rigorously evaluates platform features by testing and detecting vulnerabilities through recurring scanning and penetration testing. These vulnerability checks are performed periodically.

If necessary, you can run a penetration test on your own — provided you are authorized by VTEX — and report any vulnerabilities found. This guide explains the procedure for running [penetration tests](#penetration-tests) and submitting [vulnerability notifications](#vulnerability-notifications) on the platform.

## Penetration tests

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>All penetration tests must be previously authorized by VTEX.</p>
</div>

If you want to run your own penetration test in your store environment, VTEX will assess your request and check the possibility of running the test. To request and schedule a penetration test, follow these steps:

1. Open a ticket with [VTEX support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support), requesting to schedule a penetration test.
2. If VTEX approves the test, our team will request the necessary information for scheduling and signing the [confidentiality agreement](https://assets.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5iw8rN7CdSn7PHKvMMcO19/ab46ae4025d506e052dcef5974f9007f/Pentest_NDA_.zip). We recommend reviewing the document while waiting for test approval. If you hire a third-party company to perform the test, they must also sign the confidentiality agreement.
3. Update your ticket by attaching the signed [confidentiality agreement](https://assets.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5iw8rN7CdSn7PHKvMMcO19/ab46ae4025d506e052dcef5974f9007f/Pentest_NDA_.zip) and the information requested by VTEX.
4. Save the ticket number. You will need it for future communications.

After receiving the information, the VTEX team will contact you to confirm the penetration test.

After running the test, you must send a report with the results to [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support). 

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>Stores planning their go-live and willing to run a penetration test must also request prior authorization. In this case, they must send the report with the results to <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/support">VTEX Support</a> at least <strong>45 days</strong> before the planned go-live date. During this period, VTEX will analyze the results and address any vulnerabilities identified. </p>
</div>

### Unauthorized procedures

We recommend using only authorized tests to identify vulnerabilities. The following procedures are prohibited:

* Actions that may negatively impact VTEX, its products, or its users.For example: spam, brute force, denial-of-service, and other actions stated in [the confidentiality agreement regarding security tests](https://assets.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5iw8rN7CdSn7PHKvMMcO19/ab46ae4025d506e052dcef5974f9007f/Pentest_NDA_.zip).
* Accessing or trying to access data or information that does not belong to your account.
* Destroying or attempting to corrupt data or information belonging to VTEX.
* Any type of physical or electronic attack on VTEX personnel or property.
* Social engineering techniques.
* Breaking any laws and regulations or breaching any agreement to detect vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability notifications

We encourage our clients to responsibly report any security vulnerabilities they believe they found during authorized tests.

VTEX considers a security vulnerability to be any flaw in our components that could allow the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of products or infrastructure to be compromised in any way.

We do not consider as a vulnerability:

* Presence or absence of HTTP headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, nosniff, among others).
* Lack of security attributes in cookies.
* Cache-related issues.
* Stack error messages.
* Content injection by admin users.
* Customized store sections.
* Autocomplete enabled.

### Reporting a vulnerability

If you wish to report a vulnerability, you should first work with your security and development teams to conduct a security assessment and eliminate false positives or issues arising from custom configurations.

After this, follow the steps below if there is a vulnerability:

1. Please review the [VTEX Security Practices](https://vtex.com/us-en/security/security-practices/) document and our [Security FAQ](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/the-risk-assessment-process--4K97IpqkpCpDYsZOSxtfkX#risk-assessment-na-vtex) before reporting any vulnerabilities. These documents clarify our processes and help eliminate false positives.
2. Download the [vulnerability notification template](https://assets.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/7FNzoEpl67wH6crmW98If2/fdab37d3a7a49778abfaca7ca7531fe8/Modelo__Comunica____o_de_Vulnerabilidade_-_EN_v2.pdf).
3. Complete the vulnerability notification template with detailed information about each vulnerability detected. Add as many details as possible about the vulnerabilities you found to explain the identified suspicion, providing proof and images to help us understand, reproduce, and validate the issue.

    Vulnerabilities must be reported individually, following the template. If you encountered more than one vulnerability in your test, please complete multiple templates and attach them to your ticket.

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <p>All information must be provided and is essential for the assessment. The VTEX Security team will not address vulnerability notifications that do not follow the established template.</p>
  </div>

4. Open a ticket with our [Support](https://help.vtex.com/pt/support) to submit the security vulnerability notification. Do not forget to attach the completed vulnerability notification template in the ticket.
5. Save your ticket number, as you may need it in future notifications.

### Reply from VTEX

VTEX makes no commitment to reply to bulk reports generated by automated scanners. If your analysis is based on an automated vulnerability identification process, we recommend having a security professional review the reports to ensure the accuracy of the findings before reporting the vulnerabilities to VTEX.

VTEX is committed to responding to notifications received by [Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) as soon as possible to inform about vulnerability fixes or to provide clear reasons that prevent pursuing further analysis or fixes.

VTEX is dedicated to analyzing, verifying, and fixing any vulnerabilities reported to us that may threaten your security.
