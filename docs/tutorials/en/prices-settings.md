The **Store Settings > Products > Price Settings** page on VTEX Admin allows you to change general pricing settings in an easy and fast way. 

You can set the default markup and price variation limit for your store, as well as inherit prices from your parent account and overwrite sellers' prices with those from your account.

See all the available configurations below:

- **Default markup for new prices:** default profit percentage over a new price added to a product or service.
- **Use price variation limit:** ensures that SKU prices are not changed to undesired values.
  - **maximum decrease:** highest decrease in the price of a SKU.
  - **maximum increase:** highest increase in the price of a SKU.
- **Inherit from parent account:** option that allows the current account to inherit prices from a parent account. The price inheritance is done in the following situations:
  - **Always:** the account will always inherit all the prices from the parent account.
  - **Only for non-existent prices:** the parent account prices will be inherited only if they are non-existent in the current account.

  <div class = "alert alert-info">
    <p>The option to <b>Inherit prices from parent account</b> is only available for child accounts.</p>
  </div>

- **Overwrite seller prices:** this option overwrites all seller prices with the ones from the current account. 

  <div class = "alert alert-info">
    <p>The configuration <b>Overwrite prices for sellers</b> is not available for white label sellers.</p>
  </div>
