On VTEX, you can use [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV) to group catalog, price, promotion, inventory, shipping logistics, and payment settings for different sales channels. Sales channels include marketplaces, ecommerce websites, physical stores, or B2B stores, for example.  

The **Trade policies** section of the Admin features a list of all the trade policies added to your store. You can filter the results, search by keyword, and sort your storeâ€™s trade policies. The trade policy ID is automatically determined by the system based on the chronological order of creation. 

To [request additional trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X), contact our Growth Operations team through *[Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support)* by selecting **Commercial** and `Create a trade policy`.

Requesting additional trade policies to integrate with [native connectors](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex), [certified connectors (partners)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-certified-connector-partner), or other VTEX stores is free of charge.

## Filling in the fields
- __Name__: the name that identifies your trade policy in other modules of the VTEX Admin.  
- __Collection__: collection of products from the catalog that is valid for the trade policy.  
- __Sellers__: checkbox that associates sellers with the trade policy rules.   
- __Currency Code__: the currency that will be applied to the sales channel that uses this trade policy.  
- __Currency Symbol:__ the symbol of the currency you have selected, which will be displayed with product prices in the sales channel that uses this trade policy. This field is optional. If you leave it blank, the system will fill it in with the default symbol of the selected currency.  
- __Currency Decimal Places__: number of decimal places that product prices can have. This field is optional. If you leave it blank, the system will fill it in with the default value of the selected currency.  
- __Country Code:__ the code of the country where the sales channel is located.   
- __Culture Info:__ the language chosen for the trade policy, among the options available for the selected country.  
- __Time Zone:__ the time zone determined for the trade policy in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC).  
- __Active?:__ checkbox to activate or deactivate the trade policy in your VTEX environment.  
- __Conditional Rule:__ customizable field where you can define an additional criterion for the trade policy. An example of a conditional rule is to limit access to the store through a [customer cluster](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/como-criar-um-cluster-de-clientes).  
- __Inherit trade policy catalog:__ indicates whether the trade policy you are creating will "inherit" the catalog of an existing trade policy. If the policies are different but share the same catalog, we recommend filling in this field to optimize system performance.  

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  The field <b>Inherit trade policy catalog</b> is not changeable.
To use the same catalog in more than one trade policy, access the
<a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#post-/api/catalog/pvt/product/-productId-/salespolicy/-tradepolicyId-">Associate Product with Trade Policy</a> documentation.
