CyberSource is a [gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) that offers a number of solutions to help your store manage payments. Among them is a payment __gateway__, which offers integration with the VTEX platform. If you are looking for more details about CyberSource __antifraud__, read [this Help article](/en/tutorial/setting-up-cybersource-antifraud).

To set up CyberSource __gateway__, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __CyberSource__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the registration fields with the data provided by CyberSource (_Merchant ID/ Id of Merchant at CyberSource_, _Username / Username used on Cybersource panel_ and _Password / Password used on Cybersource panel_).
5. In the __Company's  name__ field, enter the business name of your store.
6. In __Company's CNPJ__, inform the number of your store's CNPJ.
7. In the __Currency__ field, choose the currency that will be used in your store transactions.
8. In __Private certificate (.p12)__ , upload a valid private certificate (generated by you, using a third-party certifier or software) with a .p12 extension and key.
9. In the __Private certificate password__, enter the password (it is your _Merchant ID/ Id of Merchant at CyberSource_).
10. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, the CyberSource gateway will be configured in your store. So while you're registering a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided the payment method is compatible with CyberSource).
